if coding with an AI, expressing your intentions and expectations is key. Here are my top 3 tips:

1. notes throught the code as if preparing for a future maintainer. `// TODO: ...`
2. to-dos in plain text files; README.md is usually a good candidate; to be used as context when your prompts include the entire codebase.
3. stubs as a way to guide the design suggestions.

bonus tip: think more in terms of approving diffs than writing code; the resulting process is quite different and more efficient, if wielded well.

10 years of Python and today I'm building full-stack TS.

Signs of a bigger change.
